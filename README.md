# üì∞ FakeLense: A Powerful Fake Detection Model that Combines BERT and GPT

## Introduction

Fake news refers to intentionally fabricated information spread to mislead, manipulate, or gain attention for political, economic, or other malicious purposes. The rapid proliferation of fake news, fueled by advancements in social media (SNS) and artificial intelligence (AI), has led to increasingly severe negative impacts on society. With the development of generative AI technologies, the risk of widespread distribution of fake news that is difficult to distinguish from genuine information has amplified. Moreover, fake news creators are becoming more sophisticated, concealing their identities and engaging in activities exacerbate social division and polarization.

In response to the significant security threats posed by false and manipulated information, governments worldwide are establishing new organizations dedicated to combating these issues. This project, **FakeLense**, aims to contribute to these efforts by developing an advanced tool for detecting fake news using cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) technology.

## Overview

**FakeLense** is an AI tool specifically designed to automatically detect and block the spread of fake news. By leveraging a hybrid detection system that combines the strengths of BERT and GPT models, FakeLense aims to achieve high accuracy in identifying and neutralizing fake news.

### Key Features:
  - **Hybrid Model Approach:** FakeLense combines BERT-based and GPT-based models to enhance detection accuracy.
  - **Focus on False Information:** The project targets the detection and prevention of false information‚Äîcontent that is both factually incorrect and maliciously intended.
  - **Real-time Detection:** FakeLense can be integrated into content platforms to monitor and flag potential fake news in real-time, preventing its dissemination.
  - **Mitigating Social Harm:** By effectively blocking fake news, FakeLense aims to reduce unnecessary social conflicts, prevent the polarization of public opinion, and save national resources from being wasted on dealing with the consequences of misinformation.

### Classification of Fake News:

Fake news can be categorized into three main types:

  1. **False Information:** Information that is factually incorrect and maliciously intended (false O, malicious O).
  2. **Exaggerated Information:** Information that is factually correct but exaggerated with malicious intent (false X, malicious O).
  3. **Distorted Information:** Information that is factually incorrect but not maliciously intended (false O, malicious X).

*FakeLense** focuses on detecting and blocking **false information**‚Äîthe most harmful type of fake news that misleads the public with incorrect data and malicious motives.
